# Introduce!

These repository codes are from when I was studying artificial intelligence during my younger years. I thought they might be helpful for beginners, so I'm adding new projects, refactoring the older code, and including theoretical explanations. 

I welcome everyone who is new to studying AI, and if there are any unorganized files, please note that they are currently a work in progress.
